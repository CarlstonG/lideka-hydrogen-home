## Previewing a production build

To run a local preview of your Hydrogen app in an environment similar to Oxygen, build your Hydrogen app and then run `yarn preview`:

```bash
yarn build
yarn preview
```

## Building for production

```bash
yarn build
```

## Running tests

This project contains basic end-to-end (E2E) tests in the `/tests/e2e` folder powered by [Vitest](https://vitest.dev).

You can run tests in development, and they will automatically reload when you make changes to the component you provide to `hydrogen.watchForUpdates()`:

```bash
yarn test
```

To run tests in a continuous-integration (CI) environment like GitHub Actions:

```bash
yarn test:ci
```
